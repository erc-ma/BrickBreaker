# BrickBreaker
The Full Brick Breaker Experience + Extra Power-ups

This desktop app is designed to emulate the classic game of Brick Breaker with some added features (detailed below).

What is Brick Breaker?
Brick Breaker is a game in which the player controls a bar at the bottom of the screen that can be moved horizontally. At the beginning of each round, a ball is launched from the bar and bounces off the walls and blocks.---



The GUI includes a title screen, a progression of 9 levels, an index of power-ups, a level-choosing menu, as well as a "secret" level, in which the user gets the option of playing with their favorite power-up.

Level Progression (Start)
The player plays through 9 levels in chronological order. If they are able to beat all the levels without fail, they are rewarded with a ***HAPPY PIG?? If, at any point, the player loses all of their lives, they will be sent to a game over screen ***FEATURING


### Some Cool (new) Features:

Power-ups:
I added 10 power-ups that take the form of colored icons that drop from blocks when destroyed. 
- 

Blocks:
The player beats the level once all breakable blocks are destroyed. 

10 Levels, 10 powerups; Made using native java and java swing
